# FIT1055 Prototype - Monash University Malaysia

This repository contains two Python scripts, `write_metadata.py` and `read_metadata.py`, developed as a prototype for the unit FIT1055 at Monash University Malaysia.

## Project Description

The `write_metadata.py` script is used to write custom XMP metadata onto images. It takes an image file and a set of metadata as input, and writes the metadata onto the image file.

The `read_metadata.py` script is used to read specific XMP field metadata from images. It takes an image file as input and returns the specified metadata fields.

These scripts serve as a simple demonstration of the prototype my group has decided on for Assignment 2b in FIT1055.

## Installation

To run these scripts, you will need Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the scripts.
3. Run the scripts using Python.
